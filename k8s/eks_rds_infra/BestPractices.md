## Best practices

## To connect Amazon RDS from your Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using IAM (AWS Identity and Access Management) roles and Service Accounts, you can set up a secure and IAM-authenticated connection using the following approach:

## Steps

```
Set up IAM roles and policies for accessing RDS.
Create a Kubernetes Service Account and associate it with an IAM role using IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).
Attach IAM roles to the Service Account for the pods that need to interact with RDS.
Configure RDS IAM authentication.
Update your application to use IAM authentication when connecting to RDS.
```
```
## Summary 

IAM Policies & Roles: You create IAM policies for RDS access (rds-db:connect) and create IAM roles for your EKS pods.
Service Account Association: Using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), you associate the IAM role with a Kubernetes Service Account.
Pod Configuration: You configure your pods to use the IAM role via the Service Account and use IAM authentication to connect to RDS.
RDS Configuration: Enable IAM authentication on RDS, and create IAM users within the RDS database.
IAM Authentication in Application: Modify the application to use IAM tokens for RDS authentication.
This setup ensures that your EKS pods can securely connect to RDS using IAM roles and Service Accounts, eliminating the need for static database credentials.
